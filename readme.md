# All In V1.0

Initially called "Catslot" (Had a bit of a different idea initially)

A game about gambling. A combination of the slot machine, betting (Inspired by cassino roulette) and russian roulette (since bad luck CAN kill you).

Made in about a week.

## Good to know:
- Use space bar to skip story stuff
- Your goal is to reach 1000 coins
- You lose when you lose all your hearts + the "zeroth" heart
- A bet offers a reward for when you win, punishment for when you lose and a condition - meaning what symbols must appear for you to win
