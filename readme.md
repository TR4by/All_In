# All In V1.0

Initially called "Catslot" (Had a bit of a different idea initially)

A game about gambling. A combination of the slot machine, betting (Inspired by cassino roulette) and russian roulette (since bad luck CAN kill you).

Made in about a week.

## Instructions:
- First choose a bet
  - Every bet offers a reward a punishment and shows its condition
  - A reward is what you get when you win the bet
  - A punishment is what you lose when you lose the bet
  - A condition is what symbols need to appear (and how many) for you to win
- Spin to see if you won
- Rinse and repeat!

## Good to know:
- Use space bar to skip story stuff
- Your goal is to reach 1000 coins
- You lose when you lose all your hearts + the "zeroth" heart
- There is no sound (didn't have the time)
